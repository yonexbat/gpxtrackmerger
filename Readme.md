# Two samples of rust code to read and write xml files

For newcomers to rust (like me) it is best is to have complete samples. You will find two samples to read and write xml. One sample uses a StaX like library, the other a DOM like library. Look at the file [main.rs](main.rs) in this repo. The code merges gpx files into one big gpx file. Not production ready.

## Sample xmlrssample

Read and write xml files with xml-rs like StaX. [xml-rs git](https://github.com/netvl/xml-rs/blob/master/Readme.md)

## Sample xmltreesample

Read and write xml files in DOM Mode. [xml-tree-rs git](https://github.com/eminence/xmltree-rs)
